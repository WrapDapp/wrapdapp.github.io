            <a name="q01"></a>
            <h4>How are NFT drop campaigns different from Copyright NFTs?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>NFT drop campaigns are linked to a song within your catalog. They are different
                    from our <a href="nfts.html">copyright NFTs</a>, which can only be issued once
                    per song and include all of your song's copyright information directly in the
                    NFT's metadata.</p>

                <p>Each song can have multiple NFT drops, whereas you can only have one copyright
                    NFT per song.</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q02"></a>
            <h4>How are NFT images generated?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>There are two strategies available when setting up a campaign which will
                    determine how NFT image generated for the campaign look.</p>

                <h5>Fixed Image Campaigns</h5>
                <p>This is the simpler of the two options. With a fixed image campaign, you will
                    upload as many images (as components) as you wish. Then, when an NFT is
                    generative, WrapDapp will randomly select one image from the pool of images
                    (components). That will then be the NFT's image.</p>

                <h5>Generative Image Campaigns</h5>
                <p>This is a more complicated version which requires more pre-planning on your
                    part, but the end results are far more flexible and add much more dynamism
                    to the final generated NFT images.</p>

                <p><b>Slots:</b> Generated campaigns will select ONE (1) component for each
                    slot. There are a total of NINE (9) slots available, each of which can have
                    as many component options as you wish.</p>

                <p><b>Anchor Point:</b> When selecting a component to place within a slot, the
                    application will anchor the component image to a specific corner of the
                    slot.</p>

                <p><b>Layers:</b> Layers control where the component is rendered vertically compared
                    to other components which are also rendered on the final NFT image. Higher
                    numbered layers appear above lower layered numbers, meaning that a component set
                    up
                    to render on layer 3 will appear above one set up to render on layer 1 or 2, but
                    not layer 4, 5, 6, etc..</p>
            </div>

            <h4>What are the dimensions of the final generated NFT image?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>All NFT images are 900x900 pixels in size (see next question).</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q06"></a>
            <h4>What are the dimensions of each slot in the final generated NFT image?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Each slot is 300x300 pixels in size. There are THREE (3) columns and THREE (3)
                    rows. From top left, to bottom right, the slots are numbered 1 to 9.</p>

            <h4>Why are NFTs not immediately minted when I
                generate one?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>The "minting" process is a two step process. The first step involved generating
                    the NFT image and adding all of the NFT's information into the WrapDapp
                    database.
                </p>

                <p>Once that is completed, the NFT is queued at the end of the line with all other
                    NFTs which are waiting to be minted. Out application mints NFTs against the
                    blockchain in batches.</p>

                <p>Depending on NFT minting volume, this process can take between 30 seconds and
                    several hours to complete.</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q04"></a>
            <h4>Why can't I change a campaign after an NFT has
                been issued?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Once an NFT has been generated for a campaign, WrapDapp will lock your ability to
                    make changes to the campaign other than to deactive the campaign. We do this to
                    ensure that all NFTs are generated under the same conditions, ensuring that all
                    NFTs are generated on an even playing field.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>What standard is used and on which blockchain
                are NFT drops minted on?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Every NFT drop campaign gets a dedicated ERC-1155 contract deployed to the
                    <b>POLYGON</b> network.</b> The contract will be deployed to the blockchain when
                    you activate the campaign from your WrapDapp dashboard.
                </p>
            </div>

            <a name="q09"></a>
            <h4>Can I issue my drop campaign on a blockchain other than Polygon?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Yes, however this isn't a standard feature. Please contact us directly for more
                    information on how to release your NFT drop campaign on a different network.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Can I charge people to purchase
                NFTs?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Yes! Wrapdapp is integrated with <a href="https://stripe.com"
                        target="_blank">Stripe</a>, allowing you to charge users for the
                    minting of NFTs.</p>
