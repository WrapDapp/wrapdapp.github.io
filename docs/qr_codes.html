            <h1>QR Codes on NFT Drops</h1>

            <a name="q01"></a>
            <h4>How do QR codes work with Wrapdapp
                NFT drops?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>When creating a NFT drop for a song, select the "Generative" campaign type. Next,
                    when creating a component for the campaign, select "QR Code" for the "Type" of
                    drop. You will be presented with multiple options:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Redirect URL:</b> This is where you would like to redirect users to after
                        they've scanned the QR code.</li>
                    <li><b>Width:</b> How wide the QR code should appear (in pixels) on the final
                        NFT image. Remember that NFT images are 900x900 pixels, and each cell is
                        300x300, meaning you should rarely go above 300 pixels.</li>
                    <li><b>Link Type:</b> Secure links require that the person scanning the QR prove
                        ownership via their crypto wallet, such as Metamask. This is ideal for
                        tickets, special offers, rewards, etc.. Public links can be scanned by
                        anyone without proving ownership over the NFT.</li>
                    <li><b>Background Color:</b> The color on which the QR code pattern will be
                        placed. Note: selecting "Transparent" can cause issues with some
                        backgrounds, so we recommend using a solid color most of the time.</li>
                    <li><b>Foreground Color:</b> The color which will make up the QR Code pattern
                        itself.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <a name="q02"></a>
            <h4>What is the difference between a
                "Secure" and an "Public" link for a QR code?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <h5>Public Link</h5>
                <p>When the QR code is scanned, we will not confirm that the user scanning the QR
                    code owns the NFT on which it was scanned. The user will be redirected straight
                    to the Redirect URL assigned to the QR code. This should only be used for public
                    websites that anyone can visit, such as promotional pages and marketing pages.
                </p>

                <h5>Secure Link</h5>
                <p>Unlike a Public link, a secure link requires an additional two steps. First, when
                    the user scans the QR code, they will be prompted to prove ownership over the
                    NFT via a signing request from their wallet.</p>

                <p>Once confirmed, WrapDapp's API will log the click and issue a confirmation code
                    associated with the signed click. You can then use that confirmation code to
                    ensure that the user scanning the QR code is the appropriate user.</p>

                <p>Please see the next question for more details on how this flow works.</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q03"></a>
            <h4>How do secure QR codes work and how
                can I ensure that the correct user scanned the
                code?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>For this example, we will assume that your redirect url is
                    <code>https://yoursite.com/myInternalValidationScript.php</code>, meaning that
                    the user will be redirected here upon a successful QR code scanning.
                </p>

                <h5>User Scans the Secure QR Code</h5>

                <p>When the secure QR code is scanned by a user, that user will be prompted to prove
                    that
                    they own the
                    NFT. They do this by signing a request using their crypto
                    wallet.</p>

                <h5>Validating Ownership of the NFT</h5>

                <p>Once ownership has been confirmed, WrapDapp will redirect the user to the
                    "Redirect URL", however it will add two additional query string components which
                    you can use with the <code
                        class="withSpan"><span>GET</span>/qr/{nftId}/{confirmationCode}/confirm</code>
                    API endpoint
                    to confirm that the scan is valid. These
                    query string components are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><code>_wdcc</code>: The confirmation code
                        proving that the person who scanned the QR code owns the NFT. This replaces
                        <b>{confirmationCode}</b> in the above URL. For this example, we will assume
                        the confirmation code is <b>ABC123</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>_wcnid</code>: The NFT ID. This is used
                        in the above URL to replace <b>{nftId}</b>. For this example we will assume
                        the NFT's ID is <b>xxx-yyy-ccc</b>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the above scenario, the user will be redirected to:
                    <code>https://yoursite.com/myInternalValidationScript.php?_wdcc=ABC123&_wcnid=xxx-yyy-ccc</code>
                </p>

                <h5>Validating the Confirmation Code</h5>

                <p>Now, from your <b>myInternalValidationScript.php</b> page, you can make one more
                    a request to WrapDapp's APIs at <code
                        class="withSpan"><span>GET</span>/qr/xxx-yyy-ccc/ABC123/confirm</code>. If
                    confirmed, the WrapDapp API will return the campaign information and a list of
                    all components on the scanned NFT.
                </p>

                <p>Please see the next question and the API documentation for more information.</p>

            <h4>How do I add QR codes to my
                generated NFTs?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>When creating a component for your campaign, simply select "QR Code" for "Type"
                    and follow the onscreen prompts. QR codes work the same as any generated
                    component and will be rendered directly on your final NFT image, so make sure
                    that you place them on the highest layer!</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q05"></a>
            <h4>Can I have different QR codes with
                different links on generated NFTs?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Yes, a single component can have multiple QR code options. One common use case is
                    the idea of using NFTs as a "sweepstakes": by creating multiple QR code
                    components and having them render in the same quadrant on the NFT image,
                    WrapDapp's servers will randomly select one of the options based on their
                    rarity. This allows you to mix simple "public" links with "secure" links which
                    can hold prizes, rewards, and more.</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q06"></a>
            <h4>Can I connect my QR code to my
                internal systems?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Absolutely! Once a QR code has been scanned, we redirect the user to the
                    "Redirect URL" your specified when setting up the QR Code component for the NFT.
                    This means that you can link the user directly to a page on your website which
                    does internal business logic against the request.</p>

                <p>Please see "How do secure QR codes work and how can I ensure that the correct
                    user scanned the code?" for more information on how you can ensure that QR code
                    scans are safe and reliable, especially if you are offering something of value.
                </p>

                <p>One common use case involves adding a "Secure" QR code link, which after
                    validation returns a list of components on the user's NFT, which allows you to
                    offer prizes/rewards based on the components that were rendered on the user's
                    final NFT.</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q07"></a>
            <h4>Does WrapDapp give me a way of
                determining which components were on an NFT that got
                QR code-scanned?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Yes! When you confirm a secure link click, WrapDapp's APIs will return all of the
                    campaign's information, as well as an array of all components that were rendered
                    onto the user's scanned NFT.</p>

                <p>Please see API documentation under "QR Codes" for more information.</p>
