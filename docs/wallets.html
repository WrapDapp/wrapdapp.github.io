            <h1>Wallets</h1>

            <p class="attention">It is vital that you understand the reprocussions of transfering
                ownership of
                your wallet's keys from WrapDapp's KMS to your own control. Please read this entire
                section very carefully before deciding whether to transfer ownership of your
                WrapDapp
                wallet away from the WrapDapp KMS!</p>

            <a name="q01"></a>
            <h4>How do I gain control over my wallet?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>When a publisher or provider creates an account on your (the songwriter/artist's)
                    behalf, we generate a public/private key which is securely stored in a highly
                    secure Key Management Service (KMS).</p>

                <p>When your account is created, your publisher will provide us with your contact
                    details, at which point we will reach out to you with instructions on how to
                    gain access to your wallet's key.</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q02"></a>
            <h4>How do I import my NFTs into my mobile wallet?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Each wallet is different, but in most cases you will need to know your NFT's
                    <b>contract network</b>,
                    <b>contract address</b> and <b>NFT ID</b>
                </p>

                <p>All of the above information will be e-mailed to you after your NFT has been
                    successfully minted.</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q03"></a>
            <h4>What happens to my key once it is transfered to me?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>Once we have transferred ownership of the key over to you, it is permanently
                    deleted from our KMS, meaning we can no longer use it to sign transactions on
                    your behalf.</p>

                <p>We can still mint NFTs on your behalf and transfer them to your known wallet
                    address, however we cannot sign transactions on your behalf anymore.</p>

                <p>Essentially, you are now in complete control of the wallet, your keys, and
                    anything associated with that wallet.</p>
            </div>

            <a name="q04"></a>
            <h4>Can you help me recover a wallet generated by
                WrapDapp after I've transfered the keys out of WrapDapp's KMS?</h4>
            <div class="border-light">
                <p>If you have transfered your wallet out of our KMS and you
                    lose
                    your keys after
                    that time, we cannot do anything to help you recover your wallet.</p>

                <p><b>Ownership over your NFTs is effectively lost, as is your ability to monetize
                        and
                        distribute your NFT.</b></p>
